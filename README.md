# Pbit Dataset Finder

## Table of contents:

## Description:
The goal of this project was to find in which PowerBi reports (with the extension **Pbit**), certain words would appear. The words correspond to the Dataset that is desired to be found simbolizing that a certain dataset is being used by the report in question. This could have been much simplified, but the goal was to use implementing something and learn in the process :stuck_out_tongue:, with something that was originally tasked to do, in this case using docker and mongodb.

**Note:** The conversion from Pbix to Pbit needs to be done manually unfortunately.
